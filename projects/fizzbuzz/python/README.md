Make sure you have python downloaded on your local machine or that you have .py interpreter.

1) 

This unit test uses pytest module:
You can download it using the command 

pip3 install pytest pytest-cov
 

2) Once downloaded, clone this branch onto your local machine and navigate into the folder containing fizz_buzz.py and test.py

3) Making sure you are on the folder you can run the mod:
4) Run the script with commmand, python fizz_buzz.py
5) Run the test with command pytest --cov=. test.py

 Note: there is a partial error that should be thrown by the test.py. I am new to the module so any suggestions would be appreciated.
